# [1] Define a Document class that has 3 attributes (author, title, price)
      #add the ability to read the values, i.e. getters

# [2] Add an addition function that returns a new document that adds the price
#     of the books together, the new document should have for the author field and the title field
#     a string of of comma-separated strings representing the authors and titles respectively
# of the caller and passed document content. (title and author should be the caller's)
# hint: a plus could be used as a funciton name
